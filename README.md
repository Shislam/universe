This is the universe sql file for FreeCodeCamp's Bash + Relational Databases project.
The SQL file creates a universe database with galaxy, star, planet, moon, and more_info tables.
This demonstrates exposure to database, table, column, and row creation as well as constraint manipulation (Foreign and primary keys).
